We do this to know. To know. Always to know, never to wonder. We need answers more than water. Certainty more than air.\nFor so long, Petra has been my answer to every question. She was the certainty I anchored to every night when I lost myself in the sky. Now I'm starting to wonder if it's even worth anchoring at all. Drifting seems so much easier.\n-J"

But now when I think about it, it doesn't seem crazy at all.\nIt's funny. The less you know about something, the more impressive the few things you do know are. I think that's how Petra saw me. The astronomer, conquering the final frontier. But the more she saw, the less she saw in it. And who could blame her?\n-j",

Or when a song reminds you of driving in your first car? If you think about it, patterns are a construct, not an objective thing. I haven't figured out what this means yet but I've thought about it a lot and will continue to until I crack it open. I think it's the key to this whole cosmic quandary I'm facing.\n-J"

Did you know that if you stuck all of the planets in the solar system side-by-side, you could fit them in the same amount of space as the distance between Earth and the moon? You probably did know that, actually. It's crazy how off our perspective on things can be though, isn't it?\nLike with you and Petra. You probably feel farther apart than you ever have. But our perspective can be grossly wrong, can't it? Despite everything, despite the vast distance between you, Petra still hasn't written you off. And to be honest, she probably never will. That has to mean something. Doesn't it?\nI don't know. I don't do metaphors. Just write back.\n-Lizzie"

I guess in a way that's what you did. The only way to break the pattern is to push all the way through, right?\nBut this is different. Because unlike you, I'm not running from anything. I'm running towards. I've been asking myself why I seem to care more about you than you care about yourself. And I think it's because I care about you more than I care about myself. And in a way that's unfair to both of us. Unlike you, I can't run away from everything. But I can stop "
